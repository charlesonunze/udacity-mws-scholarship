What is a service worker?

A service worker is a JS file that sits you and network requests.

It runs seperately from your webpage.

It is not visible to the user and can not access the DOM.

But it controls pages i.e intercepts requests as the browser makes them.

--------------------------

When a user goes to a page within a service worker scope, it takes control of the page. All the network request for html, css, js goes through the service worker and triggers a fetch event. You can respond to all these events.

One can respond to network request with custom code.
